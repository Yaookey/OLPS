# Mean Reversion Strategies for Online Portfolio Selection

#### PAMR: Passive Aggressive Mean Reversion

#### OLMAR: Online Moving Average Reversion

#### Anticor: Anti-Correlation

#### CWMR: Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion



Portfolio selection aims to optimize the wealth distribution of a set of assets and choose the right combination of risks and returns. Investors need to continually adjust their investment strategies with unpredictable future to maximize returns.

Four classical strategies were test in different datasets and observe results with different approaches, then compared and analyzed. 
Firstly, analyze the feasibility of these algorithms theoretically. 
Second, verify the theoretical results with known experiment data sets. 
Third, use new data set to test whether it is an effective strategy.
Finally, we compare and analyze this process then get the results.

## SUMMARY

We examine four strategies for mean reversion, PAMR, OLMAR, Anticor, and CWMR. At the same time, the strategy of analyzing these four effects can get results in different market environments to better capture trading opportunities.These strategies have been tested on the data set and have achieved good results.In the real world, in the face of huge data, the implementation ability of PAMRstrategy is very high. Although the phenomenon of mean reversion has been verified in many real markets, it is worth pointing out that PAMRâ€™s performance in risk control is not satisfactory.The OLMAR algorithm has better performance among all the algorithms in the same period, especially on the Real dataset that beats PAMR and CWMR, but it costs more time.
